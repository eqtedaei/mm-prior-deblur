## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Usage
1. Run the Algorithm: Execute the "demo_deblurring.m" to perform the deblurring process.
2. View Results: The deblurred image and estimated blur kernel will be displayed.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Dr. Jinshan Pan and Dr. Liang Chen for generously making their codes available.


Happy deblurring!
